# Wofford Repository
This repository is a collection of my coursework - homework, projects, etc. - from my time studying Computer Science (which I will also refer to as COSC) as an undergradute student at Wofford College. This repository currently contains projects from COSC 350 (in C++), COSC 375 (in R), and COSC 273 (in HDL) and more will surely be added with time.
